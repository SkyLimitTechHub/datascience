WebApp: Car Sales Dataset Generator:


The Car Sales Dataset Generator is a web-based application designed to simulate and generate realistic car sales datasets for analysis, testing, or demonstration purposes. Built using HTML, JavaScript, and libraries like Chart.js and XLSX, this tool creates datasets for sales transactions, car inventory, customer profiles, marketing campaigns, payment information, and more. It incorporates real-time data generation, Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) processing, and interactive dashboards, updating every 5 seconds. This guide explains its functionality, features, and how to use it effectively.

The application’s core feature is generating customizable datasets based on user inputs for the number of records, ranging from 50 to 1 million rows per dataset, with a capacity to handle up to 2TB for large-scale data via a server-side Python script (not included in the code). Users input the desired number of sales transactions, cars, customers, and marketing campaigns through a form. Once started, the tool generates these datasets in memory, applies ETL processes (cleaning, validation, deduplication, and enrichment), and evaluates data quality. The datasets are then visualized in seven interactive dashboards or can be downloaded as CSV or Excel files for further analysis.

The ETL process ensures data quality by filtering out invalid entries (e.g., negative sale prices or ages below 18), deduplicating records, and enriching data with calculated fields like profit margins or customer lifetime value. Data quality metrics—such as completeness, uniqueness, format consistency, and referential integrity—are calculated and displayed, guiding users on the best time to download datasets (e.g., when completeness exceeds 95% and duplicates are below 1%). A pop-up notification indicates download readiness with a status bar (green for optimal, yellow for waiting, red for poor quality).

The dashboards, accessible via a resizable and draggable modal, cover key areas: Executive Overview, Sales Performance, Marketing & Leads, Sales Team, Inventory & Supply, Financial, and After-Sales & Service. Each dashboard displays Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) like total cars sold, monthly revenue, or conversion rates, alongside visualizations (bar and pie charts) created with Chart.js. These dashboards update every 5 seconds with fresh data, and users can download them as JPG images or Excel files containing KPI summaries and chart data.

To use the application, enter the desired number of records in the input form, click “Start Real-Time Generation,” and monitor the progress bar and data quality metrics. Dashboards appear automatically after the first generation cycle, and users can switch tabs to explore different KPIs. The “Download Datasets” button saves all datasets as CSVs, while dashboard-specific downloads are available as JPG or Excel. For large datasets (>1M rows), the application suggests using the server-side Python script. The tool’s real-time updates, quality checks, and interactive visualizations make it a powerful resource for data analysts and developers.

This application is ideal for testing data pipelines, training machine learning models, or simulating business scenarios in the automotive industry. Its flexibility, combined with robust ETL and visualization features, ensures users can generate and analyze high-quality, realistic datasets efficiently.
